### ELT dbt

The initial batch of data is generated and is inside seeds directory, which is for all intents and purposes ignored from the repo. <br>
After that, each hour/day/week there's an additional CSV file is generated and dropped depenging on the parameters set. <br>
The whole process is orchestrated by Astronomer with Docker.

It is ridiculous how much Go crushed Python in terms of performance. <br>
30M rows generated in a minute is a wild result. <br>
For comparison 11M took Python just under 10 minutes. So aprox 30x difference.<br>
Unfortunately faker for Go is somewhat worse in terms of variety.

The ingestion script will scan through the /seeds directory and ignore the files the tables for which already exist. <br>
If ingestion fails it will send a message to a Telegram bot with respective error. It is kinda cool ngl <br>
